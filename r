The Divine self that you truly are the consequences of your actions in your life thus far are the things that you contend with when you realize yourself as the one in charge everything that you have created has impacted you on a level of creation those things in your environment and also those things that you characterize as the person life that you have have in fact been created by you and these have had consequences now we will talk about what consequences are and what consequences are are the ramifications of things thought and we will say thought because thought proceeds creation Now if you have a relationship that is not operating well the thoughts that you have created prior to entering the relationship are the things that have created the situation that you are in now the moment you understand that the consequences of past thought are the reasons you don't feel embodied In This Moment is the moment you become aware that you can embody because those thoughts that were created in knowing on a higher level can bypass and recreate your emotions your responses and the relationships that you have in your personal life now we will talk about a personal life what a funny way to say something everything is your personal life because you are the one inhabiting it but in fact what is being talked about is your emotional private life in relation to others and here's what the work is today we want to discuss your relationships with your fellows in terms of your awareness now Strife in a personal relationship as a reflection of a need to control on one part or on another part but if there are two people in a relationship and there is strife they will be reflected back to you in your relationships you are still the one in charge you do not change the ignorance of others by combating their ignorance that actually enhances the ignorance because it supports a requirement for protection when you real lovers can come into their knowing through the congruence of intention you can then change the self and the self will then create others in their landscape will reflect back the new Choice the new awareness and the new reality now to understand once again that you are the one in charge of all your relationships forces you immediately to abandon the idea of the belief and the investment in being one who is being victimized one for any reason now we are not talking about physical experience right now if you're walking down the street and somebody hits you in the nose because they are out hitting people in the nose yes in fact that was created by you on an experiential level but at the same time what we are really speaking of is the way you self identify as a victim that brings these experiences to you now it's much easier to blame someone else for your issues than to take responsibility for them but to the extent that you have the investment in blame you become the victim who then cannot help to transform the circumstances that she says she wishes she would once and for all change now the limitations that you have in your requirements for your freedom and relationships are about judgment and fear and a belief that you have to adhere to certain yes to control you now if you believe that if you do not behave a certain way you will not be met with love you are creating situations where your behavior is being dictated by fear and those people who are raised to be extremely polite we're told that if they weren't they would not be welcomed and consequently they have created fear based in behavior that dictates how they will be received by others now we speak this and we hear how obvious it sounds but at the same time a relationship was just party to several people the individual at the center of the relationship and though she chooses to interact with has been created by these systems for too long and the only way to change it is to become aware in your investment of what you create how you create and why you keep it in place to the extent that you do regardless of the fact that it no longer serves you at all it gives you permission to do what you want only within the parameters of pay for contractually nobody cares frankly about paying rent on a home they do not live in now if you look at a marriage an agreement between two people where there is shared information the idea of signing a contract until death is a wonderful idea but it's also a big threat and invites problems because when you state something is finite you actually have resistance to it as well now if you understood the choice to be in an agreement in a relationship or marriage that was born in Consciousness that was not Tethered contractually to a basis of fear you would find that marriage was enhanced through the awareness of the individuals involved were always choosing to be in commitment through their Consciousness and not through the dictate of an external Authority system that states this is how you will now behave this is what is appropriate behavior and these are the repercussions you will have if you do not live up to the contract which is divorce or anything else that you can think of that can be incurred through the violation and dissolution of a contract the Free Will of individuals to be in relation to one another always has to be made in an identification of conscious Choice aware choice and not through systematized jurisdiction by external Authority so to go back to our original idea of what it means to be the one of the center of your relationship what we want you to understand is that there is no one else finally choosing your life but you and if you are welcoming others into your experience in any real way you do this through identification consciously with your choice to be in relation. When you are unconscious choice you are always aware now Paul is saying what is the difference between conscious choice and unconscious choice I am not an unconscious choice in any of my relationships you absolutely are 80% of the interchanges that you have you are doing through program behavior that has very little to do with your own needs and awareness when you make an agreement to walk down the block and have a conversation with someone you are a mutual agreement and awareness of what you are choosing to do however when we say unconscious Behavior what we are really speaking of is the way behavior is informed by the patterning that you have inherited in your culture and through being raised with certain requirements and dictates about what is appropriate and as you operate from that place of Unknowing of what is conscious you can delude yourself to the end of your experience of choice here is an example you have a child that is raised to believe that she must get married one day and have children and that embedded belief informs her choices and she becomes aligned and goes into agreement with a self-identification that states that her worth is tied to behavior that has been created for her and she believes it and consequently she creates from this place and perhaps is happy because she is condoning expectation by others or perhaps she is miserable because her true self wants to be living in a cliff with a young man who eats grass and drinks out of a coconut it doesn't really matter what you choose as long as the choice is made and inherent accordance with your Divine self and to understand what the Divine self requires in its relationships has to come through an awareness of what in your life now has been created for you in unconsciousness in lack of awareness through cultural dictates parental requirements and now we will say religion and systematized ways of controlling everyone now we will talk about what that means everybody has a belief that they are free and this is true to the extent that you acknowledge that at your essence you're absolutely the one in control but you have gone into agreement about everything for better and for worse than you have created around you and to the extent that you believe that the ceiling is low that is the low ceiling you all engage in experiencing what we would intend to do with your Consciousness through your experience of this text is raised the roof but if you are operating out of systems that tell you this is appropriate this is not and the taxes are due and the toll needs to be paid and the contract needs to be signed so that I can be in accordance with others beliefs you are operating through mutual agreement that is actually based in control not Paul is saying are you preaching or teaching anarchism no no no don't be silly we are teaching awareness and we are not telling you not to sign a contract and you should pay your taxes to the extent that you are in agreement with that however you must understand that what we are asking you to do is to become conscious that you are doing these things and not to be on automatic and the disciplines that you believe falsely to be your freedom is it my freedom to pay my taxes does not make a lot of sense well in fact it's true you write the check you put the stamp on the envelope and you are in choice and in Freedom but the cultural choice to engage in this system is finally one that is about agreed control go back to the founding of this country which was a country that was born out of retaliation against an existing Authority that decided how people should be taxed in there by controlled now we will say to you but the identification of the self as the one who is in choice in her relationships in his relationships will actually begin to make you aware and underline aware of how you are not free in your relationships you were going to begin to experience yourself as operating through certain dictates that have been given to you that you have been previously unaware of and you have ascribed your own behavior in relationship to this when you are free of those things those Creations that have limited you then you can call yourself free but the coming of awareness that we are promising you is about seeing where that belief has been tainted been constricted and not been truthful in order to do this you have to become aware of your present landscape in your relationships now Paul is wondering how this is done he's feeling weary there is no need to analyze all of your relationships he says is there yes there is and not in the way that you think this is not as much an intellectual exercise it's an energetic one first things first begin to understand that every relationship you are in has an exchange of energy attached to it where are you liberated in the energies that you experience in this relationship and where are you depleted where do you feel constricted and where do you not feel honored now if you can begin to ask yourself these questions you can begin to discern why this is so and then you can understand why you choose to be an engagement with others in ways that make you feel constricted and depleted and not free now when you do this you become conscious and aware of things that have always been there I am always polite I always open the door I'm always cranky when I don't get my way whatever it might be is what you need to understand about the capability and the structure of the relationships that you have created and yes we will say again your relationships have been created for you in order to learn Who You Are that sounds selfish but in fact everyone is doing the same thing and it's a construct that is agreed upon and everybody is being talked through their interactions I am listening to myself now in a new way that will support my awareness of myself in relation to my fellows I am seeing clearly what I am required to learn from the mirrors that are presenting themselves to me in my relationships to others I am word through this intention word I am word now the responsibility has just been relegated to your own higher self the creative self to support you in bringing this to you and your awareness as you stay and your awareness you begin to understand what is before you how you create what you create and what the investment is you have in the dynamic that you have created I always feel weak in my relationships nobody ever loves me the way I want them to I am always in control and everybody acknowledges this even when they don't like it is the awareness that will support you in processing this information and making it operate in ways that will be creative for you in your experience of appropriation and acclimation as and to your own Divine self here's a little thing to know when you operate from your Divine self and we will get there eventually the relationships you create will be incongruence with it every relationship in your life right now without exception is incongruence with your vibration with your frequency and the constructs that you have created that are now being out pictured this is what you call to yourself through your consciousness and when your Consciousness changes your relationship changes in accordance with it.. Back to today you each have relationships in your lives that you feel are not working that you would like to repair and we want to give you a little bit of instruction and frequency about how to begin to work with this I am now choosing to be in alignment with my own knowing my own higher knowing about what is required to bring this relationship into perfect order and I am now seeing and understanding and becoming aware of that which is required of me in order to make this so I am word through this intention word I am worried this will bring about a configuration and a change in frequency that will support your ability to realign to the possibility of what is required to change entrance form the relationship it will not fix it we do not fix this is not about fixing if you think about fixing it's usually about control I want the relationship to go back where it was when it was working well that means going back it does not mean going forward and many times relationships change restructure and reform based on the conscious requirements of those who are involved but when we say it brings you to a new awareness we mean what it will do is give you the required information you need in order to navigate and to be in party to whatever level of change is required in the relationship you are asking about or you want healed or changed now here's another one and this is a good one through this intention word I am word when this is stated what transpires is an activation of frequency in the fields and in the place that exists between the fields or the interface between the two parties to bring the fields and the frequency into congruence with Divine frequency. Again it does not fix it real lines and if you can understand that there is a need for relationships to realign in new ways you can accept this as a healthy tool that will sponsor and invigorate the process of transformation now everybody get this when I am claiming my own dominion in my life those things that I've created that no longer serve me will be made known in order to be cleared changed and transformed this is requirement for my change Now understand that when you say this you acknowledge your worth as the creative force in your life but we have spoken a lot in this book so far about congruence and that is the key here when you were stating an intention in congruence with the Divine will your operating as an agent as an aspect of the Divine in manifestation and consciousness this is extremely different than operating from control or to fix something because you would prefer that it be the way that you think it is supposed to be remember we recently told you that this is not about thinking this is about knowing now you can delude yourself and say that you know that this relationship is meant to be or that you know this child is meant to behave in a certain way that is not harm my feelings however you don't know that you are wishing that you are intending that now we will tell you something when you are in your knowing that aspect of yourself that knows accepts and does not question Paul has been told things and a conscious level he has no agreement with whatsoever however he knows he accepts there is an aspect of him that is unable to argue because the information resonates and bypasses the thinking mind he goes into acceptance if each one of you now would once again go back in your life to a place where you knew something you knew you were in love you knew you were getting that great job you knew that your parent was passing or the dog was sick or the move would have to happen but on a deep level of resonance you knew can you do this now can you go into this place of knowing in your own self when you remember this and we say remember reconnect to that memory you will go into residence with it and this will be the Touchstone for you it is very different to know that you have been fired from a job than to think it so go to your knowing you're knowing will invigorate you and it will be your teacher so when we tell you this don't trick yourself that you're thinking is your knowing we are inviting you to bypass the self that invests in other things from a place of control or from a place of fear fear that you will not get what you want fear that will be taken from you fear that if it doesn't happen the way that you decide something must be terribly wrong with you or your world so knowing again is the placement for your Consciousness when you are in response in consciousness now we will talk about love and the need for knowing in consciousness pause when you go into love and awareness and you understand that the congruence of the actions that you take that are born out of love will always be for your highest good and the highest good of those around you you can begin to trust more effectively that the reason you are in charge of your congruence is because you have become one with your own knowing and love now Paul we will stop word I am worried day 7 there is discussion coming to you today about needing people why do you need people what does it mean when you have requirements of others to fulfill your own requirements when we get into this information we want to tell you that we will be using examples from your own life and from the lives of people you have encountered and we will be doing this carefully not in a way that is invasive and systems that are about fear in relation to others in general now to discuss fear in a relationship must signify that there is a relationship to discuss so we will take two people right now and have a little talk about them there is a young man and a young female who are existing together in a relationship the female desires the man to stand by her when she has issues that she does not like and she requires him to support her through these issues in order to feel safe to feel defended to feel right now he can say I am standing by you and he can stand by her but for him to go into agreement with her issue is to compromise himself in frequency now we will give you an example of what this means this young woman has a job where she hates her boss and she never likes what he says to her she wants his approval he never gives it she works harder for the approval and she gets angry at how hard she has to work to please this man who will never be pleased and she comes home at the end of the long day of efforting on someone's behalf and says to her partner you have to agree with me that he's a terrible boss or I work too hard for him for not enough money or create a scenario and discussion that that scene we provided you could concur with now he could say to her yes I know you do work too hard and then he is in his authority and he is stating a truth from his place of understanding and knowing to the extent that he says you have a terrible boss you are too good for the job you should get out of there he is actually condoning her in her behavior which is wrong-minded her first effort is to contend with her own issues of requiring others approval to feel validated and when she does that she will be in the right job the boss will not be the issue but to require of a partner that he goes into agreement with her issues creates congruence in absolutely the wrong way if you are in a relationship with someone and they say you have to convert to My Religion to be in a relationship with me any other person says that's wonderful I would love to do that for you that's a wonderful religion and makes that choice there is no issue but when someone else sacrifices their own Identity or those things that they require to make them feel true to themselves for the benefit of another you are not supporting Integrity in your relationship. This is about truth this is about claiming truth in your relationships in order to claim true you have to see what is there already and then you have to move from it so today if you would look at your primary relationships in your life the big ones the partnership the children the boss the Friendship whatever makes itself apparent to you first and isolate the ways that you have compromised your own knowing to go into agreement with someone else's issue by issue we mean construct of their requirements for their reality to be outpictured in a certain way now if you have a friend who engages in behavior that you know is self-destructive you can choose to love that person with a behavior intact that is the appropriate thing to do you do not withhold love from someone because they are being destructive however to agree with the behavior I understand why you do that that must be okay because it's you and I love you anyway is a horrible thing to do to someone that you love and we say horrible because you are supporting them in a lesson that they are choosing that is self-destructive now if someone is about to throw themselves down the stairs you can grab them you can let them go but how awful to say what a lovely thing to throw yourself down the stairs it is dishonest and frankly you are engaging in that behavior through your own fear of being released by the one you say you care about if I tell him to stop drinking he's not going to be happy so I'm not going to say it well telling him is one thing deciding within yourself that you are no longer going to be in a relationship while you are having to go into agreement with someone else's behavior that you cannot ideally support in truth is the right thing to claim and from that position you can begin to heal yourself what relationships we have that are destructive to us we are not saying that really we are asking you to discern about yourself where you move out of Truth where you move out of your integrity and where you align to someone else's truth in a way that bypasses your own sense of Truth. Once you understand this then you can recreate the relationship in your consciousness now what this means is I am now choosing to remain in my truth regardless of what is presented to me by way of interaction with this person I care about word I am word through this intention word I am word now Paul is saying does that mean we don't have Chinese food because I never liked it and I always agreed to have it well in a very simple level yes but it's not about Chinese food it's about honoring yourself and being a discernment there is nothing wrong with compromise and there is nothing wrong with doing for another you know this well but where there is a problem is when someone distorts their true self to get it to fit a mole that will embrace the requirements of another now this is always done when two people engage in courtship there is a kind of navigation that happens back and forth through dialogue and through frequency about whose needs are going to be met and how they're going to be shared and where they are going to be compromises and there is nothing wrong with that to the extent that everything is done in truth and in consciousness when you abnicate your Authority from a belief of fear he will leave me if I do this she will not love me if she knows this I will not be allowed home if I tell her I did that you are creating new constructs that have been born out of fear and as you create out of fear you create more fear and this misaligns misinterprets and demands more fear because that is the action of fear to create fear so to the extent that you stay in your truth and you operate from your knowing you can be in your choice so Paul is saying now does this mean we never lie in our relationships we are going to tell you this you should never lie at all lying is always without exception based and control and that control is born out of fear or selfishness which is of course a creation of fear so when you lie you create a new structure born in fear that will then have to be untethered uncreated before it moves on and does more damage we will tell you this a white lie is not white it is a lie being disguised with something pretty now we will not tell you to be harmful to say I'm sorry but I don't want to go out with you because I find you on attractive is not a nice thing to say and there is no need to be directly blunt in that interaction you can just as easily say I'm sorry I'm not going out with you I'm not available you are not available you are speaking the truth however if you say you know I'd love to but I'm really busy and I actually think I might be going in a trip that week you are being ridiculous and you're also being harmful you are sending out an energetic construct to this other person that is Born Into seat and asking them to accept that so Paul is worried now how about talking about things that are not available to discussion normally now Paul what you are really saying through this question is how do we talk about the hard stuff in honesty when we are frightened of the ramifications of the results of the discussion how do you tell someone that you are leaving them in a way that is not harmful how do you tell someone you do not feel an alignment with them in order to move forward in a relationship now lying of course is not the appropriate way to be a discussion the way to be a discussion always is from an awareness of the Divine self within you and within the partner or the person or the friend or whoever you were discussing this with when you can move into Truth at this level and witness the Divine perfection in that one that you see before you you can begin to engage them in a level of divine truth and the ego which is the aspect of the self that would control gets bypassed but in fact the doing of it is very easy I am in my knowing I am in my knowing of what is required of me in this conversation I am in my knowing of my truth and I am expressing my truth in ways that are loving and honest and I am doing this with a true awareness of the requirements of the one I am discussing with I am in my responsibility as I choose to discuss to speak to say what my heart requires that I say I am word through this intention word I am word now Paul thinks that is a cop out that's a nice way of avoiding a hard discussion imagine Paul that you have a husband who is leaving a wife for someone else that's an awful thing for people to go through it's painful it's disgusting in the emotional charge that can be released to the one being left but there are ways of having discussion as well that are high and not about fear and not about release but if you can understand please that if there was deception in this relationship that supported the affair then you have a big issue that has been undermined by a lie so of course if there had been honesty operating all the way through the system of the relationship up through the ending and dissolution of it the issue would not be that awful it would be understood and both parties would have had the opportunities to be in their awareness to be in their congruence with their knowing and then make choices higher than the ones they would have if the cat was let out of the bag a year into a process of deception of a mate do you understand the difference you are always trying to protect what you have and sometimes the need to protect someone else's feelings is extremely selfish now again we are not talking about discussion it is cruel is overtly blunt but to tell the truth in a loving way will support growth to keep someone in a position of Illusion or being disempowered in their own choices because they are being dealt with through deception is much much more difficult now we will talk about something else for a minute and this is about knowing in terms of who you are with there are signals being approached between two people in any interaction and when one person is speaking their truth and another person is navigating from a place of self-deception or deception of others you have an income ruins and emerging of the energies if one person is saying I love you and another person is saying I love you too but really they want to run for the hills that's not a very healthy situation if someone saying I love you but and the butt goes unexpressed it's going to create a new energy and this is an energy that will build until there's a dress directly so the point we want to make right now is how you learn to talk with your partner with your friend with those Close to You must now be informed by The Proposal we gift you with I am now choosing to stand in my knowing and to speak only truth in my interactions I am now choosing to know my truth and to honor my truth in all of my relationships I am no longer willing to compromise my Integrity for the sake of making someone else feel safe in their illusions or feel better about themselves at the cost of a truth that needs to be told I am learning now to heal the requirement to engage in deception on any level that presents itself in my life and I am doing this through this intention I am word through my honesty word I am word through this intention word I am word the responsibility now becomes yours and please understand that as you go about your business and you feel inclined to engage in Old patterns of deception whatever they may be you will feel very very uncomfortable and this is the situation that causes it when you bring about new behavior of any kind but habituated self and the self that believes that she requires the behavior goes into response and attempts to hold it they change that you would incur through the decree you have stated over to the water and throwing the pole and a line in you do this naturally if suddenly on a Sunday you learned you had to do something different your body and your system would still be attracted to the old itself identifies as the old and it believes itself to know itself through its Behavior so in a funny way we only mean to say that as you go forward and change you will now have to deal with the consequences of those changes through periods of uncomfortability now we told you Paul that we would use you as an example in some way and we are going to today and we are going to withdraw you a little bit so you can hear this more after the fact when one decides that one is going to be in a relationship with someone and makes that decision in their true that truth will bring forth results but there is always free will and relationships that is an experience that is blessed it can come but if you narrow the scope and the frequency of love to a limitation he will not be happy how love comes and frequency is how love comes we will give you an example if you are sitting on a hill and you decide who you love and you say love you can claim love comes to you and the form that it comes in will be the perfect form for you you can call the love of an animal or a friend or a partner now if you decide that what you really required to experience in love is mutual partnership you can call that to you as well but that is only one form that Love Takes and to Discount other forms of love that come when love is called because it does not look right or feel like or seem to damn and that damn blocks the love that would touch you at your heart in a real way so we say to you all of you now who are desirous of romance to release the structure of love as a paradigm that looks a certain way to allow the water to flow to be in the ocean of love as we stated to merge with the frequency of it and then to begin to align to the possibility that what you call to you will be in love and what you ask for maybe they're already you just have not been able to see it because you expected it to look a certain way I am word through my ability to be in love I am word through my ability to align to the frequency of love I am word through my knowing of myself as in my worthiness of love word I am word through this intention word I am word yesterday we spoke to you after the session about this book and we will speak of it again in terms of congruence this book that you are engaging with is a living organism it is made up of Consciousness and an awareness of the needs of the reader and you experience this book on multiple levels the first level you experience it is as a text with printed words in a page and this book exists there and you can call it to you in physical form anytime you wish this book also exists on an energetic frequency and it has its own properties and consciousness the example that was given and will be given again now as if the words and the page extend off the page the information it is required to bring you into new awareness we say this to you so you understand that the process you are engaging in now is one infrequency
